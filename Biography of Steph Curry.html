                <h2>Who Is Steph Curry?</h2>
                <p>
                    Wardell Stephen Curry  is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
                     Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time,
                      and as the greatest shooter in NBA history,
                      Curry is credited with revolutionizing the sport by inspiring teams and players to take more three-point shots. 
                      A nine-time NBA All-Star and eight-time All-NBA selection, including four times on the first team, 
                      he has been named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice, won four NBA championships, 
                      and received an NBA Finals MVP Award and an NBA All-Star Game MVP Award.

                <p>
                    Curry is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron, Ohio at Summa Akron City Hospital, while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.
                     He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.
                      Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.
                       The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.
                        During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.
                         He was also a member of Toronto Raptors 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario, pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.
                          Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.

                <p>
                    After Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, 
                    where he was named all-conference and all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. 
                    Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, 
                    but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.
                     He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.

                <h2> Golden State Warriors (2009–present)</h2>
<h3>Early years (2009–2012)</h3>

                <P>
                   
On June 25, 2009, Curry was selected as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.
 He appeared in 80 games (77 starts) during the 2009–10 season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes.
  His second half of the season vaulted him into the rookie of the year race. He was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January,
   March and April, finishing as the only Western Conference rookie to win the award three times. He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award behind Tyreke Evans
    and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection, becoming the first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001–02 to earn All-Rookie First Team honors.
     He scored 30-plus points eight times, setting the most 30-point games by any rookie in 2009–10 and the most since LeBron James had 13 and Carmelo Anthony had 10 in 2003–04. 
     Curry had five 30-point/10-assist games, which tied Michael Jordan for the second-most 30-point/10-assist games by a rookie (Oscar Robertson is first with 25).
      He became just the sixth rookie in NBA history to post a 35-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound game when he registered his first career triple-double with 36 points,
       13 assists and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers on February 10. In the Warriors' season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 14,
        Curry recorded a then career-high 42 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, becoming the first rookie since Robertson in February 1961 to register at least those numbers in each category in the same game.
         Curry finished his rookie season with 166 three-pointers, which were the most ever by a rookie in NBA history.

                    In 2010–11, Curry appeared in 74 games (all starts), averaging 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.47 steals in 33.6 minutes per contest.
                     His free throw percentage of .934 (212–227 FT) established a new Warriors single-season record,
                      surpassing the previous mark of .924 set by Rick Barry in 1977–78. He also became the first Warriors player to lead the NBA in free throw percentage since Mark Price in 1996–97.
                       Curry registered 20-or-more points 35 times, including seven 30-plus performances.
                        He posted a season-high 39 points and a then career-high 14 field goals (on 20 FGA) against the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 5. In February 2011, during All-Star Weekend, Curry won the Skills Challenge
                         and registered 13 points, eight assists, and six rebounds in 28 minutes as a member of the Sophomore squad in the Rookie Challenge.
                          In May 2011, he was named the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award, and underwent surgery on his right ankle.
                          In the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Curry appeared in 26 games (23 starts),
                          averaging 14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.50 steals in 28.2 minutes per contest.
                          He missed 40 games due to right ankle and foot injuries,
                          including the last 28 games with a sprained right ankle and subsequent surgery on the ankle,
                          which was performed on April 25.

                    First All-Star and playoff appearances (2012–2014)
Prior to the start of the 2012–13 season, Curry signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Warriors.[59][60] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[61] Over the course of the year, Curry and backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them the nickname the "Splash Brothers".[62] In 2012–13, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs of 22.9 points (seventh in NBA) and 6.9 assists to go with 4.0 rebounds and 1.62 steals in 38.2 minutes.[53] He established a new NBA single-season three-point record with 272 three-pointers, eclipsing the previous mark set by Ray Allen (269 in 2005–06), doing so on 53 less attempts than Allen did with Seattle.[53]

Curry earned Western Conference Player of the Month honors for the month of April, averaging 25.4 points, 8.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.13 steals in eight games in the final month of the season to become the third Warrior to ever win the award, joining Chris Mullin (November 1990 and January 1989) and Bernard King (January 1981).
 He tallied two of the NBA's top six scoring games with 54 points on February 27 at New York and 47 on April 12 at Los Angeles, becoming the first Warrior to score 45-plus at New York and Los Angeles in the same season since Rick Barry in 1966,
 joining Barry, Guy Rodgers, and Wilt Chamberlain as the only four Warriors to do so. Curry's 54 points against the Knicks included a career-best and franchise-record 11 three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50-plus points while hitting 10-plus three-pointers in a game.
  It was the most scored by a Warrior since Purvis Short tallied 59 points in 1984. In 2013, he appeared in the playoffs for the first time in his career, with the Warriors earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference. In 12 playoff games (all starts), he averaged 23.4 points, 8.1 assists and 3.8 rebounds.
   He set a new franchise record with 42 playoff three-pointers, eclipsing the Warriors' career playoff mark of 29 previously held by Jason Richardson, 
   giving him a total of 314 three-pointers for the season to become the first player in NBA history to hit at least 300 threes in a single season.
